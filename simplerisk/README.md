# SimpleRisk

Over the past several years, SimpleRisk has become the gold standard for the simplest, most effective, and affordable risk management tool on the market. Our award winning enterprise risk management solution was designed specifically for security professionals burdened by the cumbersome, time consuming, manual process of using spreadsheets and documents to perform risk management.

With a wealth of risk management functionality already in place, SimpleRisk has turned its attention to governance and compliance, as there were some major pieces of the "GRC"​ toolset that were missing - until now.

By adding governance and compliance to the risk management component, SimpleRisk has instantly become the industry’s first GRC solution to combine simplicity and effectiveness, with affordability. In addition to its wealth of risk management capabilities, with SimpleRisk GRC, you now have the ability to define:

· All of your control frameworks such as NIST, HIPAA, PCI, and others

· Controls for risk mitigation

· Tests for all controls and initiate audit at framework, control, or individual test levels

Combining simplicity, visibility, and clarity into SimpleRisk GRC enables organizations to focus on the end game – tracking and monitoring the elements of governance, risk, and compliance to effectively carry out mitigation efforts.
