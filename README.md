# Official SimpleRisk Docker images

These images are available on [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/u/simplerisk).

## Images Overview 
- [`simplerisk`](https://github.com/simplerisk/docker/tree/master/simplerisk): Contains all necessary components to make a SimpleRisk instance work (LAMP stack and mail utilities).
- [`simplerisk-minimal`](https://github.com/simplerisk/docker/tree/master/simplerisk-minimal): Only packs components for the SimpleRisk application. You will need to connect it with an external database.

## Using Docker Compose/Swarm

A `stack.yml` file is provided for a stack deployment of the application through Docker Compose or Docker Swarm. It will deploy the application with the following components:
- [SimpleRisk Application](https://hub.docker.com/r/simplerisk/simplerisk-minimal) (`simplerisk-minimal`)
- [MySQL Database](https://hub.docker.com/_/mysql) (version 8.0.X, as it uses the 8.0 tag)
- [SMTP Server](https://hub.docker.com/r/namshi/smtp)

Change its settings according to your needs.
