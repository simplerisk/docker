# SimpleRisk Minimal Image

[![Try in PWD](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/play-with-docker/stacks/master/assets/images/button.png)](https://labs.play-with-docker.com/?stack=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/simplerisk/docker/master/simplerisk-minimal/stack.yml)

This image is intended to run SimpleRisk in a 'microservices' approach (database is not included). It uses PHP 8.X with Apache as a base image. Also has the capability of setting properties of the `config.php` file through environment variables.

For any of the executions, it is recommended to map the 80 and 443 ports to be able to access the application.

## Build

To build this image, run the following commands:

```
# From the root directory of the repository
cd simplerisk-minimal
VERSION=8.X
docker build -f php$VERSION/Dockerfile -t simplerisk/simplerisk-minimal:$VERSION .
```

## Run 

There are two ways to run this container:

### Database Setup (Optional)

If this is the first time running the application, the MySQL database needs to be set up with the SimpleRisk schema. You have two options to set it up:

#### New Installer (GUI)

Since the `20220306-001` release, SimpleRisk offers a graphical installation method. You will need to run the container the following way:
```
docker run -d --name simplerisk -e DB_SETUP=manual -p 80:80 -p 443:443 simplerisk/simplerisk-minimal
```

#### Docker Setup (CLI)

You must provide the environment variable `DB_SETUP=automatic|automatic-only` and optionally provide any of the variables from the **Environment variables** section that start with `AUTO_DB_SETUP_*` to customize the setup. The only difference between the `DB_SETUP` values shown before is that `automatic` will configure the database and leave the container running until it stops, while `automatic-stop` will stop the container after configuring the database. The latter might be helpful in a situation where you only want to configure the database.

Another detail to consider is that if the database set up is being executed and the `SIMPLERISK_DB_PASSWORD` variable is not provided, the application will generate a random password and show it on the container logs.

The way to run the container on this mode are the following:
```bash
# Automatic setup (set database and keep running)
docker run -d --name simplerisk -e DB_SETUP=automatic -e DB_SETUP_PASS=test -e SIMPLERISK_DB_HOSTNAME=172.17.0.2 -p 80:80 -p 443:443 simplerisk/simplerisk-minimal

# Automatic-only setup (set database and stop container)
docker run -d --name simplerisk -e DB_SETUP=automatic-only -e DB_SETUP_PASS=test -e SIMPLERISK_DB_HOSTNAME=172.17.0.2 -p 80:80 -p 443:443 simplerisk/simplerisk-minimal
```

### Normal execution

If the database is already set up for SimpleRisk to use it, there is no need to use the `DB_SETUP` variable; you can run the container by just providing the `SIMPLERISK_DB_*` options. For example, if the database is located at `db-server.example.com` on port 45329, the command to run the container would be:
```
docker run -d --name simplerisk -e SIMPLERISK_DB_PASSWORD=pass -e SIMPLERISK_DB_HOSTNAME=db-server.example.com -e SIMPLERISK_DB_PORT=45329 -p 80:80 -p 443:443 simplerisk/simplerisk-minimal
```

## Environment variables

| Variable Name | Default Value | Purpose |
|:-------------:|:-------------:|:--------|
| `DB_SETUP` | `null` (Accepts any value) | The container will start as if the database has not been set up. The valid options here are `automatic` (in case you want the container to configure the database), `automatic-only` (the same as `automatic`, but stops the container after finishing the setup), `delete` (removes the SimpleRisk database and user from MySQL) or `manual` (allows the user to run the manual installation) |
| `DB_SETUP_USER` | `root` | Used when `DB_SETUP=automatic\|automatic-only\|delete`. User name of database privileged user to install SimpleRisk schema and other components |
| `DB_SETUP_PASS` | `root` | Used when `DB_SETUP=automatic\|automatic-only\|delete`. Password for database privileged user to install SimpleRisk schema and other components |
| `DB_SETUP_WAIT` | 20 | Used when `DB_SETUP=automatic\|automatic-only`. Time, in seconds, the application is going to wait to set up the database. Useful if you are deploying the database and SimpleRisk at the same time |
| `SIMPLERISK_DB_HOSTNAME` | `localhost` | Hostname of the database server |
| `SIMPLERISK_DB_PORT` | 3306 | Port to contact the database |
| `SIMPLERISK_DB_USERNAME` |`simplerisk` | User name to be used to access the SimpleRisk database |
| `SIMPLERISK_DB_PASSWORD` | `simplerisk` | Password to be used to access the SimpleRisk database. If not provided while setting up the database, a random password will be generated and shown on the container logs |
| `SIMPLERISK_DB_DATABASE` | `simplerisk` | Database name where all SimpleRisk objects are stored |
| `SIMPLERISK_DB_FOR_SESSIONS` | `true` | Indicator that the application will store all sessions on the configured database |
| `SIMPLERISK_DB_SSL_CERT_PATH` | Empty string (`''`) | Path where SSL certificates, to contact the database, are located |
| `SIMPLERISK_CRON_SETUP` | `enabled` | Install the cron job to run in this Docker container |
